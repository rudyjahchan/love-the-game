# Don't Hate the Player; Love the Game

You've got it all down. You're team is balanced. You have this great process. You're ready, baby.

And then your client doesn't get it.

It's a problem we've encountered many times and decided to finally tackle. So with a diverse team of designers, developers and product managers we did the obvious thing; built a game!

Games have long been used as a way to speed learning and validate theory. We'll talk about:

* the balanced team practices such as collaborative design, prototyping, testing, and iterating that went into our games' creation
* other games and simulations in and out of our field
* and most importantly, having fun along the way

After that, we'll lead a workshop so that other people can play the game.
